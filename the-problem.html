    <h1>Gender bias and gender stereotypes are significant barriers to a woman's progress in Engineering</h1>

    <div id="biasText">
      <p>Engineering fields are often seen as a masculine profession, encouraging the stereotype that females are delicate and intellectually inferior to men although there is no evidence supporting this stereotype. A woman's competence and talent often come into question in male-dominant fields such as Engineering. An incredibly talented female would have to work much harder than a visibally less talented male in order to achieve the same goals. A broader term to describe the female experience in supposed masculine fields would be flat out sexism.</p>

        <p id="representation">Lack of female representation can lead to scientific bias in engineering. Scientific bias is defined as a flaw in the study, design, or collection of data and the interpretation of information. This leads to a flaw in the final product or service of a certain research project. Research requires careful analysis using the human thought process. As a result, personal values, interests, and perspectives of engineers often lead to biases in the products they make. Without female representation women are at a clear disadvantage when it comes to engineered solutions to universal problems with solutions that are male centered, arising from a male-dominated field.</p>

      <div id="payText">
      <p>In STEM careers-especially engineering- women make significantly less than men for the same job title. On average, women make an annual salary that's about 72% of what men do. This pay gap is what makes engineering such an undesirable profession for females. Without access to equitable salaries women are discouraged to dedicate their lives to follow an engineering profession. As a result, engineering continues to be male-centered, exlusive of women. This allows stronger gender stereotypes to form labeling women as incapable in comparison to men which just isn't true.</p>
