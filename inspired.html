      <h2>Hedy Lamarr</h2>
      <p>Hedy Lamarr was a gifted mathametician,engineer, and inventor. Her most well known work was her contribution to encryption and wireless communication. Hedy developed the base for today's Wi-fi, GPS, and bluetooth devices. Despite her amazing work as an engineer, people tend to focus primarily on Hedy's work as an actress. She faced plenty of gender discrimination in the engineering sector. She was praised for her beauty and belittled for her brain. Regardless of her experience Hedy continued striving to have her brain be as memorable as her beauty by dedicating her time to creating magnificent inventions.</p>

    <h2>Lillian Gilbreth</h2>
    <p>Lillian Gilbreth was a psychologist and a mechanical engineer. Being a psychologist, Lillian studied the family home and developed ways in which the quality of a home could be maximized. This led to the common inventions of shelves inside refrigerator doors and a foot-pedal trashcan. Living in a traditionalist era, higher education was unorthodox for females. Lillian was rejected from studying at Columbia University on account of the professor refusing to teach females. Despite this mysoginy, Lillian sought higher education elsewhere and eventually became the first female professor in the engineering school at Purdue University. She was also the first woman elected to the National Academy of Engineering, </p>

    <h2>Ellen Ochoa</h2>
    <p>Ellen Ochoa studied electrical engineering at Stanford University earning a Phd in 1985. Upon graduating, Ellen worked as a research engineer for NASA where she helped create optical systems used in the recognition of objects. Recieving recognition for her work, Ellen was chosen by Nasa to complete an astronaut training program. In 1991, she became the first Hispanic female astronaut. In a CNCB interview Ellen revealed that she faced discouragement on her journey as an engineer. Despite these difficulties, Ellen continued her studies, getting her inpiration and encouragment from female astronaut Sally Ride and Hispanic astronaut Franklin Chang Diaz. This shows how important representation and diversity are in engineering fields.</p>

    <h2>Donna Auguste</h2>
    <p>Donna Auguste studied electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley. She often faced both racial and gender discrimination during her time as a student. Her professors often told her that she didn't belong in their lectures and Donna's male classmates repeatedly refused to work with her on projects. Her journey was tough and she faced several barriers yet Donna graduated UC Berkely and moved on to earning a Phd in Computer Science where she did research on artificial intelligence. Thanks to her expertise, Donna later became a lead software engineer for Apple in the early 1980's. Despite any discouragment, Donna continued to be strong and follow her passions.</p>
